# Hachathon-2020

This repository stores the code and results in Hackathon-2020, aiming to analyse the real dataset  and synthetic dataset if diabetes.

The dataset and descriptions can be found at https://biolib.com/GATTAC/Diabetes-Machine-Learning-Data-ornq/ or in the folder "data".

## An outline of our work

- Train a model on synthetic data to predict re-admission of the patients, compare the performance on synthetic data and real data.
- Train a Neuron Net to classify real data and synthetic data.
- Analyze the result of the last step, find the most significant difference between two datasets.

## Detailed description of each step

#### 1. Train a model to predict re-admission of the patient.
